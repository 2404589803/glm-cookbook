Welcome to the GLM API model entry warehouse 📘, this is not a official repos and it is a small project in my spare time.

Here, you will find a wealth of **code examples👨‍**, **practical guides🗺**️ and **resource links🔗**, which may help you easily master the use of GLM API!

## Quick Start 🚀

1. To start using the GLM API, you first need a GLM API account and the corresponding API key.
    If you don’t have an account yet, you can register for free [here](https://open.bigmodel.cn/).

2. My code is based on **Python, Jupyter Note**, but the same concept can be applied to other programming languages (but you may have to implement it yourself).
    These code examples are intended to help me (and perhaps you) how to use the GLM API efficiently to complete common simple tasks. It is recommended to use `Python 3.9 - 3.12`
    version (my own is Python 3.10). You need to install the necessary dependencies to better use the Demo. You can use the following command to install total dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. By the way, I usually use ✅GLM4 to complete tasks. I also recommend you to use this model!

## Warehouse file 📂

I have classified multiple folders, each of which has its own content. You can view it according to your needs!

+ 🌱`basic` The most basic content is just a successful call.

+ 👁️`vision` About multi-modal calls and basic applications.

+ 🔧`finetune` Maybe you can come here to find fine-tuning content? (coming soon)

+ 🤖`agent` Let’s see how powerful the agent at the press conference is! (coming soon)

+ 🎉`demo` Some interesting sum demos, which may inspire some inspiration. (coming soon)

+ 🏠`asset` Some tutorials may help you understand better.

You can quickly understand the structure of this warehouse through the following pictures. I will update the latest experiments and teaching content of Zhipu AI SDK as soon as possible.
