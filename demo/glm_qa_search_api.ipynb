    "# Using GLM Models to finish QA using a search API and re-ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial is available in English and is attached below the Chinese explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "本脚本参考了[OpenAI CookBook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_a_search_API.ipynb)的代码，并使用 GLM 系列模型实现同样的功能。\n",
    "\n",
    "**步骤 1：搜索**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 用户提问。\n",
    "2. 由 GLM-4 生成潜在查询列表。\n",
    "3. 并行执行搜索查询。\n",
    "\n",
    "**步骤 2：重新排序**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 使用每个结果的嵌入来计算与生成的用户问题理想答案的语义相似度。\n",
    "2. 基于这个相似度度量对结果进行排序和筛选。\n",
    "\n",
    "**步骤 3：回答**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 给出最顶端的搜索结果，模型生成用户问题的答案，包括引用和链接。\n",
    "\n",
    "这种混合方法提供了相对较低的延迟，并且可以集成到任何现有的搜索端点中，而不需要维护一个向量数据库！我们将使用[News API](https://newsapi.org/)作为搜索领域的示例。\n",
    "\n",
    "This script refers to the code in [OpenAI CookBook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_a_search_API.ipynb) and implements the same functionality using the GLM family of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User asks a question.\n",
    "2. Generate a list of potential queries by GLM-4.\n",
    "3. Execute search queries in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Rerank**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the embedding of each result to calculate the semantic similarity with the generated ideal answer to the user's question.\n",
    "2. Sort and filter the results based on this similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given the top search results, the model generates an answer to the user's question, including citations and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach provides relatively low latency and can be integrated into any existing search endpoint without the need to maintain a vector database! We will use the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) as an example in the search domain."
